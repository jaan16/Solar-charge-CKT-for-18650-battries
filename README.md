# Solar-charge-CKT-for-18650-batteries
Solar charge controller 
This project provides a schematic design for a high-efficiency Solar Charge Controller capable of converting solar input (16V to 20V, 9A) to a regulated battery output (4V to 1.75A). The design utilizes a CN3791 charge management IC, MOSFETs, inductors, and resistors to ensure stable power delivery and efficient energy conversion. The circuit is optimized for Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) to harness maximum solar energy.

## Features
-Input Voltage Range: 16V to 20V, up to 9A
-Output Voltage Range: 4V at 1.75A
-MPPT Capability: Maximizes solar energy harvesting
-Compact and Efficient Design: Supports stable charging and minimal energy loss
-Protective Elements: Integrated with diodes and capacitors for noise suppression and protection

## Applications
Ideal for battery charging setups powered by solar panels, suitable for renewable energy projects, off-grid power systems, and portable electronic devices.
